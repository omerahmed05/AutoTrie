# AutoTrie

AutoTrie is a C++ autocomplete program that uses a Trie (prefix tree) data structure. Users can type a prefix and instantly receive word suggestions from an English dictionary.

The program loads words from a `dictionary.txt` file located in the root directory, which contains all English words used for autocomplete.

The contents of `dictionary.txt` were taken from the [dwyl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) repository. The original file name is `words.txt`.
